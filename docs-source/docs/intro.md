# Overview

Using real-time predictive modeling, ActionHub identifies and prioritizes messaging objectives (the "best next action") for a given customer with the goal of increasing consistent engagement with your brand. ActionHub then makes these messaging recommendations available to owned products and third-party systems for message orchestration and campaign targeting. The ActionHub.ai Platform includes as numerous pre-built integations to make getting started easier as well as a robust REST API that support simple and large-scale integrations with any system. ActionHub integrations helps businesses effectively coordinate the delivery of high-impact marketing messages across different channels and touchpoints, including email, social media, websites, and mobile apps.
