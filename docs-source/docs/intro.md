# Overview

Using real-time predictive modeling, ActionHub identifies and prioritizes messaging objectives (the "best next action") for a given customer with the goal of increasing consistent engagement with your brand. ActionHub then makes these action recommendations available to owned products and third-party systems for message orchestration and campaign targeting. 


As a centrally integrated system, ActionHub helps businesses effectively coordinate the delivery of their marketing messages across different channels and touchpoints, including email, social media, websites, and mobile apps.

1. **Increase conversion rates with targeted and timely action recommendations**
1. **Improve customer experiences by providing relevant, cohesive marketing content across all channels**

## How ActionHub Works

ActionHub uses first party customer engagement data (e.g. item orders, content consumption, etc.) and uses that data to build predictive models based on engagement patterns across the entire customer base. Individual customers (referred to as users in ActionHub) have individual event histories which are fed into the model, resulting in a scored list of action recommendations. These action recommendations can be determined in real-time and delivered via a low-latency API to any integrated system and used for content selection decision making.
