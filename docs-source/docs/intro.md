## Overview

RE2 is a marketing system that generates "next best action" recommendations based on first-party data and makes those recommendations
available to third-party systems for message orchestration and campaign targeting.

## Next Best Actions

"Next best actions" are important in digital marketing because they help businesses to identify and prioritize the most effective actions to take with a particular customer or prospect. These actions are typically based on data and insights about the customer's needs, preferences, and past interactions with the brand.

By identifying and executing the next best action, businesses can effectively engage and convert customers, and drive desired outcomes such as increased sales and customer loyalty.

There are several benefits to using next best actions in digital marketing:

1. Improved customer experience: By providing personalized and relevant recommendations and actions, businesses can improve the customer experience and build stronger relationships with their customers.
1. Increased conversion rates: By presenting customers with targeted and timely actions, businesses can increase the likelihood of conversion and drive desired outcomes.
1. Enhanced data-driven decision making: By using data and insights to identify the next best action, businesses can make more informed and data-driven decisions about how to engage and convert customers.

Overall, next best actions are a powerful tool for businesses to optimize their marketing efforts and drive desired outcomes in the digital age.

## Message Orchestration

Message orchestration is important in digital marketing because it helps businesses to effectively manage and coordinate the delivery of their marketing messages across different channels and touchpoints. This is especially important in today's digital age, where consumers interact with brands through a variety of channels, including email, social media, websites, and mobile apps.

Effective message orchestration can help businesses to:

1. Deliver a consistent and cohesive message across all channels, ensuring that the brand's messaging is consistent and aligned with its overall marketing strategy.
1. Personalize the marketing message based on the customer's interactions with the brand, using data and insights to tailor the message to the individual's needs and preferences.
1. Optimize the timing and frequency of message delivery to ensure that the right message is delivered to the right person at the right time.
1. Track and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, using data and analytics to understand how customers are responding to different messages and adjust the strategy accordingly.

Overall, message orchestration is a key aspect of digital marketing that helps businesses to effectively communicate with their customers and drive desired outcomes.
