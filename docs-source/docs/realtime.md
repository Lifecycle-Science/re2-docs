Omni-channel message orchestration is the process of coordinating and managing marketing communications across multiple channels, such as email, social media, SMS, and more, in order to provide a seamless customer experience.

When thinking about their requirements for omni-channel message orchestration, companies should consider the following:

- Customer needs: What are the needs and preferences of the company's target customer segments? How do these customers prefer to communicate and receive marketing messages?
- Company goals: What are the goals of the company's marketing efforts? What outcomes does the company hope to achieve through its omni-channel message orchestration efforts?
- Available resources: What resources (time, budget, personnel, etc.) does the company have available to invest in omni-channel message orchestration?
- Integration with other systems: How will the company's omni-channel message orchestration efforts fit in with other systems and processes, such as customer relationship management (CRM), marketing automation, and more?
- Scalability: How will the company's omni-channel message orchestration efforts scale as the company grows and its customer base expands?
- By considering these factors, companies can develop an effective strategy for omni-channel message orchestration that meets the needs of their customers and supports the overall goals of the business.
