Customer targeting is the process of identifying specific groups of customers that a business wants to reach and target with its marketing efforts. This is often done as part of a larger customer segmentation strategy, where a business has already divided its customer base into smaller groups with similar characteristics.

Once a business has identified specific customer segments to target, it can then create marketing campaigns and strategies that are specifically designed to appeal to these groups.

Here are a few examples of customer targeting:

- Demographic targeting: This involves targeting customers based on characteristics such as age, gender, income, education level, and more. For example, a business selling luxury cosmetics might target women aged 35-55 with high incomes.
- Geographic targeting: This involves targeting customers based on their location. For example, a local restaurant might target customers within a certain radius of its location.
- Behavioral targeting: This involves targeting customers based on their past behaviors and actions. For example, a business might target customers who have previously shown an interest in a certain product or service.
- Interest-based targeting: This involves targeting customers based on their interests and hobbies. For example, a business selling outdoor gear might target customers who are interested in hiking and camping.
- Personalization: This involves tailoring marketing efforts to individual customers based on their specific needs and preferences. For example, an online retailer might recommend products to a customer based on their past purchases and browsing history.
