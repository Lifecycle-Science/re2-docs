Programs define the operating parameters for a given 
scope of user engagement. *_All events and actions (including labels 
and assets) and are handled within the context of a specific program._* 
Programs are typically aligned to a set of use cases that share 
similar user context. Program configuration options include the dials
and switches for optimizing ActionHub behavior to meet the needs of a given 
use case.
