# Tagging

## Tag Types

There are two types of tags available in RE2: (1) asset tags, and (2) event tags.

### Asset tags
Asset tags allow marketers to identify asset characteristics and categories that can be useful in making product associations.
For example: a brand name for a product or release year for a movie could be asset tags. 
Asset tags are managed in the RE2 admin interface.

### Event tags
Event tags are delivered at the time an event is recorded and indicate context about the event which can be useful in making event associations.
For example: the device used for a purchase or a discount code applied could be event tags.
