# Introduction to RE2

At a high-level RE2 evaluates time-series event logs of your highly engaged users to identify the most relevant and engaging next steps for any customer. By default RE2 will drive users to take the actions that are most likely to increase engagement and produce long-term retention (sustained action frequency). However RE2 also allows you to also overlay specific engagement objectives such as "expand category adoption" or "increase repeat purchase frequency".
RE2 platform consists of four products:
Core event processing for event handling and real-time decision-making
Low-latency API for programatic integration to managed cloud-based core service instance
Administration utitlities for defining objetives, designing experiments, and configuring optimization metrics
Reporting tools for action and asset performance insights


R2E2 does not require any PII (Personally Identifiable Information).
